# DEPRECATED

This standalone Node.js companion app has been **deprecated**.
Its functionality (detailed window tracking to the `app_usage_log` table) has been fully integrated directly into the `desktop-tracker` Python application.

You no longer need to run this Node.js app. The new `desktop-tracker` handles both the timeclock work/break tracking and the detailed window usage logs in a single, lightweight background process.
